This method of edge detection can uses the difference between a pixel and the surrounding pixels to test for edges. This is done using a kernel, where a larger kernel can be used to reduce noise more. The most common kernel used is the 3x3, and is the one used in this program. The kernel is slid from pixel to pixel so that all pixels except the outer edge are given a new value. The value assigned is 8 times the central pixel minus the sum of the 8 surrounding pixels. This algorithm makes edges appear lighter and non-edges appear darker. This algorithm is only effective on images that have first been greyscaled however because of the way colour is stored as RGB in images.
