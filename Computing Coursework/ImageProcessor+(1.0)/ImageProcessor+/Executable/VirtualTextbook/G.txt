Greyscale is used to change a colour image into a grey image. In this instance this is to improve the effect of the Laplacian Edge Detection algorithm. To change an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) value to gray each colour value must be extracted then multiplied by a fraction based on how important each colour is to human vision. A good approximation, which is used in this program, is: 0.3*R , 0.6*G, 0.1*B. From this you can tell that green is the most important colour for the human eye, and that blue is the least important. These multiplied values are then added together and this is the grey value. the final step is to set all three colour channels of the pixel to this grey value.
