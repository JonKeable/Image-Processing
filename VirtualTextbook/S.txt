Smoothing takes the mean of all the pixels in a kernel in order to smooth out edges in images. To do this a kernel is used, and in this program it is a 3x3 kernel. It is slid from pixel to pixel so that all except the outer edge of pixels have their value changed to that of the mean of the 9 pixels in the kernel. The mean is calculated as: Total of all pixel values / Number of pixels (in this case 9)
