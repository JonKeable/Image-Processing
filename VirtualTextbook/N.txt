This algorithm takes the median of all the pixels in a kernel in order to remove noise whilst smoothing the image minimally. To do this a kernel is used, and in this program it is a 3x3 kernel. It is slid from pixel to pixel so that all except the outer edge of pixels have their value changed to that of the median of the 9 pixels in the kernel. The median is calculated as: When all values in the kernel are placed in order of magnitude, the middle value is the median. In practice in this program this means sorting the 9 elements and then choosing the 5th element as the middle value.
